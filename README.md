# Abstract

There are many problems that face transportation movement such as Driving Behavior and Attitude, Traffic Accidents, Road and Environment Incidents. 
Our main problem that we chose is Road and Environment Incidents. We chose this problem as people ignore it even though it is one of the most important transportation issues.
Road and Environment Incidents include ground crashes, pipeline explosions, falling rocks, tree crashes, rains and floods, fire and explosions. 
Maintaining and fixing these problems as early as possible reduces the possibility of accidents.
We came up with this idea to help the government to fix these issues as early as possible, and users to be up to date with road issues to avoid being in danger.
We developed a mobile application to make users report incidents easily and fast using their mobile camera which images captured will be processed by our AI model.
On the other hand, we have a web application to monitor reports and help admins to manage them.
